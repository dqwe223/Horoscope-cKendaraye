# Horoscope-cKendaraye

Welcome to Horoscope-cKendaraye, my first project in C language. This application is a unique creation, designed to provide personalized horoscopes based on various age groups and gender-specific characteristics.

Overview

This project was developed using the if function in C to identify and categorize different age ranges along with their typical objectives and behaviors. By creating a model that considers both male and female perspectives, the application aims to deliver the most accurate and relevant horoscopes tailored to individual users.

Features

    Age-Specific Analysis: The program identifies different age groups and provides horoscopes that align with their common behaviors and objectives.
    Gender-Specific Customization: Recognizing that males and females have different wants and needs, the application divides the horoscopes into two parts, ensuring personalized and accurate predictions.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive command-line interface, making it easy for users to get their horoscope.

How It Works

    Identify Age Groups: The program first categorizes the user into an age group.
    Determine Objectives and Behaviors: Based on the age group, the program identifies common objectives and behaviors.
    Gender Differentiation: The program then differentiates between male and female users to further customize the horoscope.
    Provide Horoscope: Finally, it delivers a personalized horoscope that reflects the user's age and gender-specific characteristics.
